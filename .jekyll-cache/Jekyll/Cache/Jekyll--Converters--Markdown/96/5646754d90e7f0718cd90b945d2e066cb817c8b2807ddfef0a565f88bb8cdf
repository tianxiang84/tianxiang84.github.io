<p>I bought a book on data-driven dynamical system earlier this year right before the pandemic spread in the US (ref. 1). The book was writen by two Professors at University of Washington and was published quite recently. It talks about dynamical systems, but instead of focusing on the classical theories that we learnt in school, it focuses more on how data can help us identify and reduce the order of the systems. This post summarizes my understanding on the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) method after reading Session 7.2 of the book.</p>

<h3 id="what-dmd-does">What DMD Does</h3>
<p>DMD essentially tries to learn the dynamics of a system using data without equations and physics. Unlike training a deep learning neural network, however, DMD aims to do the ‚Äúlearning‚Äù fast and efficiently.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs first talk about data, the inputs to DMD. The inputs to the DMD algorithm are in the form of two matrics.</p>
