          <h3 id="problem-description">Problem Description</h3>
<p>In this exercise, I would like apply the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) algorithm on a simple problem to familiarize myself with DMD. I will first generate the evolution history of a 2D oscillating system. I will then embed the 2D dynamics into a 3D space (put a planar curve into a 3D space) and corrupt the 3D signal with noise. The noisy 3D data will be fed into the DMD algorithm. I want to see if I can recover the true 2D dynamics from the corrupted 3D signal. The code below is written in MATLAB. I created the toy problem myself and modified the DMD codes in ref 1 to make it work for the problem.</p>

<h3 id="data-creation">Data Creation</h3>
<p>This first session has nothing to do with the DMD algorithm. The goal is to generate input data. Along the way, I will also try to refresh my memory on how to understand complex-value eigenvectors and eigenvalues for a linear dynamical system, which will help understand the DMD outputs later. Consider the following 2D dynamical system:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d z_1}{dt} = - 4 \pi z_2,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d z_2}{dt} = \pi z_1.
\end{equation}
We will use initial conditions $z_1(0)=2$ and $z_2(0)=0$. The solution to this linear dynamical system is $z_1(t)=2\cos(2\pi t)$ and $z_2(t) = \sin(2\pi t)$. It is a periodic solution with period $T=1.0$ second.</p>

  <figcaption>Fig.1 - Evolution of the 2D dynamical system considered in this exercise.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Before generating data for the DMD algorithm, let‚Äôs first think about the eigenvectors and eigenvalues for this simple system. Looking at Fig.1, it is clear that there should be no real-value eigenvector-eigenvalue pair for this system. Because if there is such a pair (and let‚Äôs denote it as $\vec{v}_z - \lambda_z$), it will satisfy:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\vec{v}_z}{dt} = \textbf{A}_z \vec{v}_z = \lambda_z \vec{v}_z.
\end{equation}
Geometrically, the above equation says the flow direction $d\vec{v}_z$ is parallel to the state vector $\vec{v}_z$. We know we don‚Äôt have such a state because the flow in Fig.1 never points at the origin $z_1 = z_2 = 0$. So we know an eigen calculation will end up with complex-value results.</p>

<p>How should we understand the complex-value eigen results? Let‚Äôs say we have an eigenvector $\vec{v}_z = \vec{v}_r + i \vec{v}_i$ and an associated eigenvalue $\lambda_z = \lambda_r + i \lambda_i$. They will satisfy:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\vec{v}_z}{dt} = \textbf{A}_z \left( \vec{v}_r + i \vec{v}_i \right) = \left(\lambda_r + i \lambda_i\right) \cdot \left( \vec{v}_r + i \vec{v}_i \right).
\end{equation}
Separating the real and imaginary parts, we have:
\begin{equation}
\textbf{A}_z \vec{v}_r = \lambda_r \vec{v}_r - \lambda_i \vec{v}_i,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\textbf{A}_z \vec{v}_i = \lambda_r \vec{v}_i + \lambda_i \vec{v}_r.
\end{equation}
If $\lambda_r=0$, we will get:
\begin{equation}
\textbf{A}_z \vec{v}_r = - \lambda_i \vec{v}_i,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\textbf{A}_z \vec{v}_i = \lambda_i \vec{v}_r.
\end{equation}
Geometrically, it says when the state is along $\vec{v}_r$, the flow should point along $\vec{v}_i$, and vice versa. This is exactly what Fig. 1 shows us. For example, at any point along the $z_1$ axis, the flow points at the $z_2$ direction. It‚Äôs also clear from the equation that $\lambda_r$ tells us whether the dynamics is winding out ($\lambda_r&gt;1$), converging ($\lambda_r&lt;1$) or following the same orbit again and again ($\lambda_r=1$), while $2\pi/\lambda_i$ gives us the period of the oscillation.</p>

<p>With the above knowledge, it is not surprising that when we perform eigen calculation for our system, we get $\vec{v}_r = [0.8944,0]‚Äô$, $\vec{v}_i = [0, -0.4472]‚Äô$, $\lambda_r = 0.0$ and $\lambda_i = 2\pi$.</p>

<p>How do we represent the solution in the eigen space when the eigen results are complex numbers?
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\vec{z}}{dt} = \textbf{A}_z \vec{z}.
\end{equation}</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = \left[\textbf{W}^{-1} \textbf{A}_z \textbf{W} \right] \vec{v}.
\end{equation}</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
d\vec{v}} = \left[\textbf{W}^{-1} \textbf{A}_z \textbf{W} \right] \vec{v}.
\end{equation}</p>

<p>In the MATLAB code above, the variable $z$ represents a 2D dynamics. The variable $y$ is a rotation of $z$, which is then embedded into the 3D variable $x$. Finally, some noise is added to $x$ to corrupt the signal. The data is visualized in the plot below. It is a 2D ellipse in a 3D space.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-find-the-reduced-order-space">Step 1: Find the Reduced Order Space</h3>
<p>In this session, we will use SVD to find a reduced order space for the 3D signal. Here the reduced order $r=2$ is assumed to be known. Ref. 1 gives a procedure to determine the optimal order. For this exercise, I want to focus on the DMD algorithm itself so will take a shortcut here.</p>

<pre>
  <code class="matlab">
    [U, Sigma, V] = svd(X,'econ');
    r = 2;
    Ur = U(:,1:r);
    Sigmar = Sigma(1:r,1:r);
    Vr = V(:,1:r);
  </code>
</pre>
<p>Note here the subspace is determined by $\textbf{X}$ and has nothing to do with the matrix $\textbf{X}‚Äô$. If you check the matrix $\textbf{Ur}$, you will find SVD correctly get the reduced state space for us. For me, the $\textbf{Ur}$ matrix is:</p>
<pre>
  <code class="matlab">
    Ur = [-0.7075, 0.7067; -0.7067, -0.7075; -0.0002, -0.0001];
  </code>
</pre>
<p>Next we will need to learn the dynamics from data in this reduced space.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-find-the-dynamics-in-the-reduced-order-space">Step 2: Find the Dynamics in the Reduced Order Space</h3>
<p>We will use SVD to learn the 2D dynamics in the learnt reduced space.</p>
<pre>
  <code class="matlab">
  Atilde = Ur'*Xp*Vr/Sigmar;
  [West, Lambda] = eig(Atilde);
  </code>
</pre>
<p>Here $\tilde{A}$ represents the linear dynamics in the reduced order space, i.e., we learn from the data that the $y$ state evolves as $\vec{y}‚Äô = \tilde{A} \vec{y}$, or the $k$ step is $\vec{y}(k) = \tilde{A}^{k-1} \vec{y}(0)$. In the plot below, the projected raw data on the $y$ space is shown as dots, and the learnt dynamics is shown in a black curve. I can see on the first period, the learnt dynamics matches with the data quite well. But due to numeric error ($\text{det}(\textbf{A})$ is slightly less than $1.0$), in subsequent periodes, our trajectory begins to shrink.

<p>The Schur decomposition helps us find the eigen vectors and values for this 2D dynamics.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-recover-the-3d-signal-using-the-2d-dynamics">Step 3: Recover the 3D Signal Using the 2D Dynamics</h3>
<pre>
  <code class="matlab">
  Phi = Xp*(Vr/Sigmar)*West;
  alpha1 = Sigmar*Vr(1,:)';
  b = (West*Lambda)\alpha1;
  
  nc = 100;
  Xest = zeros(3,nc);
  for i=1:1:100
    Xest(:,i) = Phi*(Lambda^(i-1))*b;
  end
  </code>
</pre>

<h3 id="step-4-plotting-the-results">Step 4: Plotting the Results</h3>
<pre>
  <code class="matlab">

  plot3(Xest(1,:),Xest(2,:),Xest(3,:),'k-','LineWidth',2.0); hold on;
  </code>
</pre>
<p>If you run the entire code, you will find we succesfully recover a smooth 3D curve using a learnt 2D dynamics. Noise is removed and the 3D data set is digested into a 2D dynamical system.</p>

          <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>I bought a book on data-driven dynamical systems (ref. 1) earlier this year right before the pandemic began to spread across the US. The book was writen by two professors from University of Washington and was published quite recently in 2019. The book talks about dynamical systems, but instead of focusing on the classical theories that we learnt in school, it focuses more on how data can help us identify and reduce the order of the systems. Session 7.2 of the book introduces a method named ‚ÄúDynamic Mode Decomposition‚Äù (DMD. I find it interesting because, essentially, the method enables us to use data to discover, characterize and predict how a dynamical system evolves. More importantly the characterization could be done in low order (i.e., with few degrees of freedom), which means if the data is from a high fidelity model, the method gives us a way to produce a reduced order model. This post summarizes my current high-level understanding of DMD after reading Session 7.2 of the book. Here I will not cite the papers already cited in the book, if interested, please look up the original research papers from the book.</p>

<h3 id="what-dmd-does">What DMD Does</h3>
<p>DMD tries to learn a linear dynamical system from data and efficiently predict its behavior. Unlike training a deep learning neural network, however, DMD aims to do the ‚Äúlearning‚Äù efficiently. The data fed into the DMD algorithm are pairs of the state of a system separated by a small time interval $\Delta t$, for example, snapshots of the system at $t=10.0$s and $t=10.1$s. By digesting these pairs of ‚Äúbefore and after‚Äù states, DMD learns how the system evolves in the time period of $\Delta t$. And if you know how a linear system changes in small $\Delta t$, you can predict its state at any time after an initial state is given. Note that here no physical law is used, we rely totally on data, although the data itself can be from some high-fidelity simulator that uses physics.</p>

<h3 id="how-dmd-works">How DMD Works</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs first talk about the data fed into the DMD algorithm. Let $\vec{x}=[x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n]^T$ be the state of a $n$-degrees-of-freedom dynamical system. Note that it is a column vector. We select a few, say $m$, snapshots of this system at different time and arrange these column vectors into a matrix $\textbf{X} = [\vec{x}(t_1), \vec{x}(t_2), \cdots, \vec{x}(t_m)]$. For each snapshot, we also get the state of the system after a time delay $\Delta t$, and arrange these states in a second matrix: $\textbf{X}‚Äô = [\vec{x}(t_1+\Delta t), \vec{x}(t_2+\Delta t), \cdots, \vec{x}(t_m+\Delta t)]$. Now we would like to find a linear dynamical system such that:
\begin{equation}
\textbf{X}‚Äô = \textbf{A} \textbf{X}.
\end{equation}
Here $\textbf{A}$ is a linear transformation that maps a column in $\textbf{X}$ to a corresponding column in $\textbf{X}‚Äô$.</p>

<p>Naturally, one would think that if we could do an ‚Äúinverse‚Äù of the $n \times m$ matrix $\textbf{X}$ so that $\textbf{A} = \textbf{X}‚Äô \textbf{X}^{-1}$, then our mission is accomplished. This is indeed a valid thought and SVD (singular value decomposition) can help us perform the psudo inverse. The problem is that when we have a large $n$, computing the $n \times n$ matrix $\textbf{A}$ becomes expensive, not to mention that later we may need to further compute some properties of the system by manipulating $\textbf{A}$ so we can efficiently predict the long-time evolution of the system. DMD gave us a procedure to find $\textbf{A}$ efficiently.</p>

<p>Since the main issue is that we have a high-dimension system with a large $n$, let‚Äôs imagine we have a magic solution to reduce the order of the system via a orthonormal mapping $\textbf{U}$:
\begin{equation}
\vec{x} = \textbf{U} \vec{y}.
\end{equation}
Here $\textbf{U}$ is a $n \times r$ matrix, and $\vec{y}$, our magic new reduced order state with less degrees of freedom, is a $r \times 1$ vector with $r &lt; n$. Now the evolution of the system can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\textbf{U} \textbf{Y}‚Äô = \textbf{A} \left( \textbf{U} \textbf{Y} \right).
\end{equation}
So the reduced order states follows:
\begin{equation}
\textbf{Y}‚Äô = \left(\textbf{U}^* \textbf{A} \textbf{U} \right) \textbf{Y} = \textbf{A}_y \textbf{Y}.
\end{equation}
Here $\textbf{A}_y = \textbf{U}^* \textbf{A} \textbf{U}$ is a definition.</p>

<p>Assuming we know how to compute $\textbf{U}$ so we can convert our data from the $\vec{x}$ to the $\vec{y}$ space, then computing $\textbf{A}_y$ should be a ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù operation. Since $\textbf{A}_y$ and $\textbf{A}$ are related, by learning $\textbf{A}_y$ from data, we also obtain $\textbf{A}$.</p>

<p>One benefit of obtaining a linear dynamical system is that we could decouple it to efficiently predict its long-time evolution. Decoupling the $n \times n$ $\textbf{A}$ matrix is expensive, but the lower order $\textbf{A}_y$ could help. As a classical eigen problem exercise, the next step is to find a tranform $\textbf{W}$ between $\vec{y}$ and a new state $\vec{z}$ (also of order $r$):
\begin{equation}
\vec{y} = \textbf{W} \vec{z},
\end{equation}
so that the dynamics of $z_i$ are decoupled: 
\begin{equation}
\textbf{Z}‚Äô = \textbf{A}_z \textbf{Z}.
\end{equation}
Here $\textbf{A}_z = \text{diag}(\left[ \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \cdots, \lambda_r \right])$ is a $r \times r$ diagonal matrix. In the $z$ space, the decoupled variables evolve following:
\begin{equation}
z_i(t) = \exp \left(\lambda_i t \right) z_i(0).
\end{equation}
Here $i=1,2,\cdots,r$ and $\lambda_i$ are the complex-value eigen values.</p>

<p>To summarize, to reduce a high-dimensional data set to simple dynamics, one need to do two transforms, one from $\vec{x}$ to $\vec{y}$, followed by a second one from $\vec{y}$ to $\vec{z}$. Note that data matching is achieved when we compute $\textbf{A}_y$. Then we revert those transforms to predict how $\vec{x}$ will evolve.</p>

<h3 id="the-unexplained-magic-step">The Unexplained Magic Step</h3>
<p>I have left the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù step on transforming $\vec{x}$ to $\vec{y}$ unexplained above. This order reducing step can be achieved by using SVD decomposition of the $\textbf{X}$ matrix. It has been explained in the book (ref. 1) in earlier sessions.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been working with Professor Y. Marzouk and his postdoc P. Rubio on a Schlumberger project for the past year. One interesting technique I learnt from them is the so-called transport map. 
It is not about how to fit all MBTA routes onto an A4 paper, although everytime I saw the MBTA map on a bus I wonder if there is any math behind the design of that map. The transport map I learnt during the past year is about how to represent a complex probability distribution. Without sharing any Schlumberger related things, this post tries to document my understanding of the basics of transport maps (all have been published by Marzouk earlier, see ref.1 for example).</p>

<h3 id="what-transport-maps-can-do-for-us">What Transport Maps Can Do for Us</h3>
<p>Imagine the following scenario. We know $x$ is a random variable that follows a standard Gaussian distribution. There is a complex function (maybe the function is only available numerically) $y=f(x)$ that transforms any given $x$ to a scalar $y$. What can we say about the distribution $P(y)$? Apparently one can sample a lot of $x$, pass them to the function $f$ to generate samples of $y$, then use statistics to describe the $y$ samples. This is great. But sometimes we may want to get an analytical expression for $P(y)$, or in some cases we are only given some samples of $y$ without any knowledge of $x$ and $f$ but we want to have a machinary to keep generating new samples of $y$ that minic the given samples. Transport maps can help.</p>

<p>Another scenario transport maps can help is when we are given an un-normalized distribution (maybe only numerically, i.e., if you give me a value $x$, I can tell you $P(x) \sim h(x)$ where $h$ doesn‚Äôt have an analytical expression but can be computed numerically following some procedure). Transport map can help us construct a normalized distribution and subsequently draw samples from it.</p>

<h3 id="how-transport-maps-work">How Transport Maps Work</h3>
<p>A transport map is a transform between a reference distribution and a targe distribution. We can use any simple distribution we like as our reference distribution and the target distribution is the one that we want to describe. The map is parametrized. The goal is to optimize those parameters so that after the transformation, the obtained target distribution matches any information we have about the target distribution. At the end of the day, finding a transport map becomes a loss minimization problem for parameter optimization.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs say we are given some samples of $y$ and would like to (1) Obtain an analytic expression for $P(y)$ and (2) Generate more samples of $y$ ourselves. First thing we do is to pick a reference distribution we like. Say a standard normal distribution $P_x(x) \sim N(0,1)$. Then we define a parametrized map $y=f_\theta(x)$. Here $\theta$ are the parameters we will need to find/optimize later. Given any set of the parameters $\theta$, we can express $P_y(y)$ analytically as $P_y(y) = P_x({f_\theta}^{-1}(y)) | \nabla {f_\theta}^{-1} |$. Basically given any $y$, we say let‚Äôs transform it back to $x$ via $f_\theta^{-1}$ and see what‚Äôs the probability that $x$ appears ($P_x(x)$). We then adjust that with the Jacobian of the transform $f{_\theta}^{-1}$. With an parametrized and analytic $P_y(y)$, we now optimize the parameters so that $P_y(y)$ matches with the samples of $y$ given to us. This optimization can be done by minimizing the KL divergence between $P_y$ and the samples.</p>
