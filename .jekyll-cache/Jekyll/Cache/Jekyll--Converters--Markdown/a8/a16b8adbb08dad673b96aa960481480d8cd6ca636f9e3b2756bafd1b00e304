<p>I had some confusion on SVD yesterday on when and where we introduce approximation on the DMD algorithm. My thought was that, intuitively, we cannot find an exact linear map to transform one set of points to another random set of points. Because of the randomness, the exact map most likely is nonlinear and nonlocal. But in the 2nd step of DMD where we learn the linear dynamics from data, when and where do we make an approximation? This exercise was created to clear that confusion.</p>
