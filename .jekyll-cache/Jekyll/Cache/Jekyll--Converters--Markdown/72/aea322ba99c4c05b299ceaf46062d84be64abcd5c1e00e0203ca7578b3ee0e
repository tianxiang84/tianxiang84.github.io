<p>I bought a book on data-driven dynamical systems (ref. 1) earlier this year right before the pandemic began to spread across the US. The book was writen by two professors from University of Washington and was published quite recently in 2019. The book talks about dynamical systems, but instead of focusing on the classical theories that we learnt in school, it focuses more on how data can help us identify and reduce the order of the systems. Session 7.2 of the book introduces a method named ‚ÄúDynamic Mode Decomposition‚Äù (DMD. I find it interesting because, essentially, the method enables us to use data to discover, characterize and predict how a dynamical system evolves. More importantly the characterization could be done in low order (i.e., with few degrees of freedom), which means if the data is from a high fidelity model, the method gives us a way to produce a reduced order model. This post summarizes my current high-level understanding of DMD after reading Session 7.2 of the book. Here I will not cite the papers already cited in the book, if interested, please look up the original research papers from the book.</p>
