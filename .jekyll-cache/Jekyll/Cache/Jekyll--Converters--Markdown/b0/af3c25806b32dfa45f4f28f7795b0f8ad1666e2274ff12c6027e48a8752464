<p>| <img src="/images/about/Deformed.png" width="500" height="120" /> | I have been doing projects in the areas of computational mechanics, vision-guided industrial robot pick and place, deep-learning based computer vision and more recently real-time system parameter inference using Bayesian inference. |
| <img src="/images/about/Harvard_Wreath_Logo_1.svg" width="500" height="120" /> | Before joining Schlumberger, I was a post-doctoral researcher in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/">the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a> at Harvard University from 2011 to 2013. I was co-advised by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bertoldi.seas.harvard.edu/">Dr. Katia Bertoldi</a> (Harvard) and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/flexlab/">Dr. Pedro M. Reis</a> (was at MIT and now at EPFL).|
| <img src="/images/about/penn.gif" width="500" height="120" /> | I did my Ph.D. study in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.me.upenn.edu/">the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics</a> at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> from 2007 to 2011. My advisor is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~purohit/">Dr. Prashant K. Purohit</a>.|
| <img src="/images/about/Thwlc.jpg" width="500" height="120" /> | I studied solid mechanics and biophysics when I was at UPenn. My <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/371/">Ph.D. thesis</a> discusses the mechanics of floppy polymer filament networks: how they deform under Brownian motion and external applied forces. |
| <img src="/images/about/200px-Peking_University_seal.svg.png" width="500" height="130" /> | I was an undergraduate student in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_University">Peking University</a> (Beijing) from 2003-2007, majored in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.mech.pku.edu.cn/">Theoretical and Applied Mechanics</a>. My undergraduate thesis discusses the mechanics of an enzyme called $\alpha$-lytic. My supervisor is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/facultyaz/891173.htm/">Dr. Huaiqiu Zhu</a>.|
| <img src="/images/about/guangzhou.jpg" width="500" height="150" /> | I grew up in the city of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a> in south China before I moved to attend college in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing">Beijing</a>.
