title: "Courses in CMU" 
---

Write before job hunting. Life in CMU is like hardtack, real hard and substantial. The courses offered are awesome. Life was so compact that I feel like having learnt more than twice as much as what I would learn if I were not at CMU. One of the most impressive scenes I would never forget was that the shuttle driver would bless the students on every Friday -- _have a nice weekend everyone!_ It's kind of like embarrassing, as CMU students don't have weekends. They are rolling in the dues, like a hamster in the roll chasing the endless goals. Maybe my courses are a bit tough, but I do enjoy them.

### Machine Learning

* [Introduction to Machine Learning (10-701)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10701-15F/).(&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;) Fundamental course for machine learning. It introduces categories of machine learning problems, such as supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised learning, or classification, regression, clustering. More emphasis is laid on classification and clustering. Compared with 10-601, it has an extra research project and lays more emphasis in mathematical derivations. The practical part is also solid. We implemented our own Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Regression, AdaBoost, K-means. As final project, I implemented Message Passing for fully connected layer in caffe for distributed training. Though practically we don't do this in fully connected layer because of synchronization cost, but it's still a worthwhile practice for beginner.

* [Machine Learning with Large Datasets (10-605)](http://curtis.ml.cmu.edu/w/courses/index.php/Syllabus_for_Machine_Learning_with_Large_Datasets_10-605_in_Fall_2015) (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;). Selling points is hands-on practice for machine learning. All the seven homeworks are carefully designed, including Naive Bayes with Hadoop and pig, Logistic Regression with Sparse Updates, Matrix Factorization on Spark, Topic Model on Parameter Server, Bloom Filter, etc. It not only teaches adaption of algorithms for big data settings, but also touches Big Data frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, Parameter Servers, GraphLab, etc.

* [Probabilistic Graphical Models (10-708)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10708-16/lecture.html) (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;). This course includes very heavy literature review. Of course it depends on you whether to read them carefully or not. A lot of emphasis is laid on Topic Models because of the research interest of the instructor and TAs. Homework requires very heavy mathematical derivations. Shortcoming of this course is that it lacks a little practice for some of the topics. Besides heavy derivations, we implemented trigram-HMM, parallel coordinate descent, sampling methods such as Metropolisâ€“Hastings, Gibbs Sampling, etc.

* [Topics in Deep Learning (10-807)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/10807_2016/). Taking...

### Systems

* [Introduction to Computer Systems (15-513)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/) (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#127775;). This course is pre-requisite to many cs courses, and it's real fundamental. It's so famous that its course number is also the zip code of the university. It covers assembly, memory hierarchy, locality, linking, exceptional control flow, virtual memory, IO, networks, concurrency, which are truly fundamental for cs courses like os, compiler, architecture, networks, etc. Do take this course if you want to be a system programmer.

* [Parallel Computer Architecture and Programmer (15-618)](http://15418.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2016/) (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#127775;). Taught by [Kayvon](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kayvonf/); he gives super impressive lectures! The material covers quite cutting-edge technologies. One of the stunning fact I learnt from the course is that sometimes computational cost may not be bottleneck, but the memory latency! Having much computational resource, then use it. Well, that's not everything though. The most important point I learnt is about profiling and analysis. We shouldn't be blinded when doing optimization, and we only do optimization when we need to. The homeworks are also very interesting, including a CUDA renderer, a GraphLab-like framework, and an elastic web server. The project I chose is to implement [LSTM](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) with [Halide](http://halide-lang.org/), which improves CPU performance by making use of vector ALUs and multi-core execution.

* [Distributed Systems (15-640)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15-440/) (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;). It teaches fundamental techniques used in distributed systems, such as Remote Procedure Call, Caching, Elasticity, Logging, Availability, etc, along with protocols such as Adaptive Replacement Cache, Gifford voting, Paxos, etc. Most of the time the instructor teaches philosophy about system design, such as one-copy semantics, trade-off between consistency and availability. Generally speaking, it's okey, except for two aspects. One thing is that the instructor taught a little bit too slow and answered a lot of unrelated questions in class. The other thing is that the homework were not well designed. The test cases were not given, students were confused what they were tested on. The TAs made a lot of traps in the test cases of auto graders, without letting students know where the traps were.

* [Computer Networks (15-641)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~prs/15-441-F16/). Taking...

### Misc

* [Computer Graphics (15-662)](http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2016/). Taking...

* [Introduction to Computer Security (18-730)](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~lbauer/courses/18730/f2015/)(&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;). It gives a general introduction of the topics in computer security, including elementary cryptography, protocol analysis, network security, and host/software security. Homework includes decrypting cbc cipher, convert-channel attack, and web attacks such as xss, csrf, sql injection. Shortcoming is that the material seems to be a little bit too abstract, and assumes a lot of backgrounds from students.

* __Behavioral Decision Making (88-602)__ (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;). CMU is famous in the subject of Behavioral Decision Science; also I'm interested in psychology, so I took this course. It uses [The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making](https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Judgment-Decision-Making-McGraw-Hill/dp/0070504776/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1471728425&sr=8-1&keywords=Scott+Plous-The+Psychology) as textbook, which I would give a 5-star recommendation! This course discussed various kinds of bias when people make decisions, such as selective perception, confirmation bias, representativeness heuristic, framing effect, etc. In addition, it also discussed the techniques to reduce the bias. My final paper discussed the hype in Artificial Intelligence in the stance of the general public and the researchers. I gave 4 stars because the young instructor did not teach in a well-organized way.
