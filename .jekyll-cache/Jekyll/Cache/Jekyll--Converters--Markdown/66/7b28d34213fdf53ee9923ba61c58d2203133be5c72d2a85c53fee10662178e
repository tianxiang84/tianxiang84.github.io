<p>I bought a book on data-driven dynamical system earlier this year right before the pandemic spread in the US (ref. 1). The book was writen by two professors at University of Washington and was published quite recently. It talks about dynamical systems, but instead of focusing on the classical theories that we learnt in school, it focuses more on how data can help us identify and reduce the order of the systems. Session 7.2 of the book talks about a method named the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). I find it quite interesting because essentially the method enables us to discover, characterize and predict how a dynamical system evolves using data. More importantly the characterization could be low order
This post summarizes my understanding on the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) method after reading Session 7.2 of the book.</p>
