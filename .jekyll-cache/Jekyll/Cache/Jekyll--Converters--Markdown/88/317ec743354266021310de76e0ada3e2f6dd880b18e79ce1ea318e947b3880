<p>In this exercise, I would like to create a toy problem to test the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) algorithm. In particular, I will first use a perfect 2D dynamical system to generate some noisy 3D data. I will then feed the noisy 3D data into DMD and see if I can recover the true 2D dynamics. The code below is written in MATLAB. I created the toy problem myself and have modified the original DMD codes in ref 1 to make it work for the toy problem.</p>

<p>In this session, I would like to create some 3D noisy data for a perfect 2D dynamical system.</p>

<pre>
  <code class="matlab">
    % create data
    t = 0:0.01:5;
    z1 = 2.0 * cos(2.0*pi*t);
    z2 = 1.0 * sin(2.0*pi*t);
    Z = [z1; z2];
    %plot(z1,z2); hold on;
    
    W = [sqrt(2.0)/2.0, -sqrt(2.0)/2.0; sqrt(2.0)/2.0, sqrt(2.0)/2.0];
    Y = W*Z;
    y1 = Y(1,:);
    y2 = Y(2,:);
    %plot(y1,y2); hold on;
    
    X = [Y; zeros(1,length(y1))];
    x1 = X(1,:) + normrnd(0.0,0.01, 1,length(y1));
    x2 = X(2,:) + normrnd(0.0,0.01, 1,length(y1));
    x3 = X(3,:) + normrnd(0.0,0.01, 1,length(y1));
    X = [x1;x2;x3];
    %figure; plot3(x1,x2,x3); hold on; axis equal; grid on;
    
    Xp = X(:,2:end);
    X = X(:,1:end-1);

<p>In the MATLAB code above, the variable $z$ represents a perfect 2D dynamics. The variable $y$ is a rotation of $z$, which is then embedded into the 3D variable $x$. Finally, some noise i</p>

<h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3>
<pre>
  <code class="matlab">
    [U, Sigma, V] = svd(X,'econ');
    r = 2;
    Ur = U(:,1:r);
    Sigmar = Sigma(1:r,1:r);
    Vr = V(:,1:r);
  </code>
</pre>
<p>If you check the matrix $\textbf{U}$, you will find SVD correctly get the reduced state space for us.</p>
