<p>Iâ€™ve been working with Professor Y. Marzouk and his postdoc P. Rubio on a Schlumberger project for the past year. One interesting technique I learnt from them is the so-called transport map. It is definitely not about how to draw/fit all MBTA routes onto an A4 paper, although everytime I saw the MBTA map on a bus I wonder if there is any math behind the design of that map. The transport map I learnt during the past year is about how to represent a complex probability distribution.</p>
