| <img src="/images/about/Schlumberger_06.jpg" width="500" height="120" /> | I am a Research Scientist at Schlumberger-Doll Research Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Iâ€™ve been here since October 2013. |
| <img src="/images/about/Deformed.png" width="500" height="120" /> | I have been doing projects in the areas of computational mechanics, vision-guided industrial robot programming, deep-learning based computer vision and more recently real-time system parameter inference using Bayesian inference. |
| <img src="/images/about/Harvard_Wreath_Logo_1.svg" width="500" height="120" /> | Before joining Schlumberger, I was a post-doctoral researcher in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University from 2011 to 2013. I was co-advised by Dr. Katia Bertoldi (Harvard) and Dr. Pedro M. Reis (MIT).|
| <img src="/images/about/penn.gif" width="500" height="120" /> | I did my Ph.D. study in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics at University of Pennsylvania from 2007 to 2011. My advisor is Dr. Prashant K. Purohit.|
| <img src="/images/about/Thwlc.jpg" width="500" height="120" /> | I studied solid mechanics and biophysics when I was at UPenn. My Ph.D. thesis discusses the mechanics of floppy polymer filament networks: how they deform under Brownian motion and external applied forces. |
| <img src="/images/about/200px-Peking_University_seal.svg.png" width="500" height="130" /> | I was an undergraduate student in Peking University from 2003-2007, majored in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. My undergraduate thesis discusses the mechanics of an enzyme called $\alpha$-lytic. My supervisor is Dr. Huaiqiu Zhu.|
| <img src="/images/about/guangzhou.jpg" width="500" height="150" /> | I grew up in the city of Guangzhou in south China before I moved to attend college in Beijing. |
