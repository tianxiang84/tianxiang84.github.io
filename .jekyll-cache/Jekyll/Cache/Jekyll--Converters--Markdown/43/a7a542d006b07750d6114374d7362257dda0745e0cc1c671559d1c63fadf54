I"³<p>Recently I was following an <a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231n/syllabus.html">online course</a> on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) provided by Stanford. I find it a very nice hands-on material: slides and notes are easy to understand. Purely reading formulations can be confusing sometimes, but practicing experiments helps better understanding what the formulations and the symbols in them are expressing.</p>
