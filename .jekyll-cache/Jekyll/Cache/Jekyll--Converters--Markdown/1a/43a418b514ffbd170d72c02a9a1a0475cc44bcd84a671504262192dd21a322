<p>Iâ€™ve been working with Professor Y. Marzouk and his postdoc P. Rubio on a Schlumberger project for the past year. One interesting technique I learnt from them is the so-called transport map. It is not about how to fit all MBTA routes onto an A4 paper, although everytime I saw the MBTA map on a bus I wonder if there is any math behind the design of that map. The transport map I learnt during the past year is about how to represent a complex probability distribution. Without sharing any Schlumberger related things, this post tries to document my understanding of the basics of transport maps.</p>

<p>Imagine the following scenario. We know $x$ is a random variable that follows a standard Gaussian distribution. There is a complex function (maybe the function is only available numerically) $y=f(x)$ that transforms any given $x$ to $y$. What can we say about the distribution of $y$?</p>
